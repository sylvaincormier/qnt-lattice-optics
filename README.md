**Repository:** `qnt-lattice-optics`

## Overview
This repository contains the open research and design materials for a quantum nanotube-based architecture capable of acting as a **photonic repeater** and **distributed quantum sensor**. It leverages:

- Vertically-aligned carbon nanotube arrays
- Encapsulated noble gases
- Metallic or catalytic coatings (e.g., Pt)
- Diffraction-based ensemble readouts
- Lattice optical behavior and quantum resonant phenomena

Our goal is to provide an **open scientific framework** for next-generation quantum communication infrastructure that is:

- Decentralized by design
- Passive and solid-state
- Scalable to large array sizes
- Sensitive to quantum and environmental fields
