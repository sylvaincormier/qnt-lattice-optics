[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/954944290.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15085938)

**Repository:** `qnt-lattice-optics`

## Overview
This repository contains the open research and patent-ready design materials for a quantum nanotube-based architecture capable of acting as a **photonic repeater** and **distributed quantum sensor**. It leverages:
- Vertically-aligned carbon nanotube arrays
- Encapsulated noble gases
- Metallic or catalytic coatings (e.g., Pt)
- Diffraction-based ensemble readouts
- Phonon-photon interactions for signal modulation
- Room-temperature quantum operations
- Acoustic isolation via polymer matrix engineering

Our goal is to provide an **open scientific framework** for next-generation quantum communication infrastructure that is:
- Decentralized by design
- Passive and solid-state
- Scalable to large array sizes
- Sensitive to quantum and environmental fields
- Operable at room temperature without cryogenic requirements
- Resilient against common decoherence mechanisms
